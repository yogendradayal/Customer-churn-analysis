# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data from a telecom company to uncover key patterns and insights using Python.

It involves thorough **data cleaning**, **preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualizations** to understand factors contributing to customer churn.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, impacting revenue and growth.
This project explores the **Telco Customer Churn dataset** and focuses on:

- ✅ **Data Loading & Inspection**
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** (handle blanks, fix data types, remove duplicates)
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify churn drivers
- 📊 **Data Visualization** using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- ✨ **Feature Transformation** for better interpretability

The notebook walks through the end-to-end process, making it easy to extend into machine learning pipelines later.

## 📊 Key Insights
Here are some of the major findings from the analysis:

Customers on month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate.
Higher monthly charges are correlated with increased churn.
Shorter tenure customers are more likely to leave early.
Senior citizens and customers without partners or dependents exhibit distinct churn behaviors.
